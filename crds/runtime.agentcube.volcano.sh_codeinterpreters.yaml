          CodeInterpreter defines the desired state of a code interpreter runtime environment.

          This runtime is designed for running potentially untrusted, LLM-generated code in an
          isolated sandbox, typically per user/session, with stricter security and resource controls
          compared to a generic AgentRuntime.

                  traffic into the sandbox (e.g., /execute, /files, /health).
