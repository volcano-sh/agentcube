        # We don't need to install it here because run_e2e.sh handles cluster creation if not exists,
        # but using the action is cleaner for setup. However, run_e2e.sh does `kind create cluster`,
        # so we should probably let the script handle it or adjust the script.
        # Looking at run_e2e.sh, it runs `kind create cluster`.
        # To avoid conflicts, let's just install kind tool but not create cluster, OR let the action create it and skip creation in script.
        # Simplest is to install kind and let script run.
