# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** 2026-01-22

**AgentCube** is an open-source project designed to be deployed and hosted by users on their own infrastructure (Kubernetes). This plugin serves as a client to facilitate the connection between Dify and your self-hosted AgentCube instance.

## 1. No Data Collection by Project Maintainers

The developers and maintainers of the AgentCube open-source project and this plugin **do not** collect, store, process, or have access to any of your personal data, code, or execution results.

## 2. Data Control and Ownership

*   **Self-Hosted Infrastructure**: All data processing happens on your own infrastructure. The code (`code`), commands (`command`), and configuration parameters (`router_url`, `workload_manager_url`) are transmitted directly from your Dify environment to your private AgentCube deployment.
*   **User Responsibility**: You maintain full ownership and control over your data. The privacy, security, and retention of your data are governed entirely by your own infrastructure's security policies and the configuration of your AgentCube deployment.

## 3. Data Flow

Data transmission occurs strictly between:
1.  **Dify**: The platform where you utilize the plugin.
2.  **Your AgentCube Instance**: The service you have deployed and manage on your Kubernetes cluster.

No data is sent to any external servers or third-party services managed by the AgentCube project team.

## 4. Contact

If you have technical questions regarding the deployment or security configuration of AgentCube, please refer to the documentation or open an issue in the [AgentCube repository](https://github.com/volcano-sh/agentcube).
