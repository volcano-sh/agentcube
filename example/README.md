# Example to test api of agentcube-apiserver

This test program demonstrates and validates the api of agentcube-apiserver

## What it does

1. **Generates SSH Key Pair**: Creates an Ed25519 public/private key pair
2. **Creates Session**: Sends the public key to agentcube-apiserver when creating a session (waits for sandbox to be running)
3. **Establishes Tunnel**: Creates an HTTP CONNECT tunnel to the sandbox
4. **SSH Connection**: Connects via SSH using private key authentication (no password!)
5. **Executes Commands**: Runs basic test commands to verify SSH connectivity
6. **Uploads File**: Uses SFTP to upload a Python script to the sandbox
7. **Executes Script**: Runs the Python script which generates output data
8. **Downloads File**: Uses SFTP to download the generated output file
9. **Verifies Output**: Validates the downloaded file content

## Prerequisites

- agentcube-apiserver running (locally or in Kubernetes)
- Sandbox image built with SSH key support
- Kubernetes cluster with agent-sandbox controller (if deploying sandboxes)

## Building

```bash
cd example
go mod tidy
go build -o client client.go
```

## Running

### Default (local agentcube-apiserver)

```bash
./client
```

### Custom API URL

```bash
API_URL=http://your-server:8080 ./client
```

### From project root

```bash
# Run directly
go run ./example/client.go

# Or use the helper target
make client
```

## Expected Output

```

SSH Key-based Authentication Test
===========================================

Step 1: Generating SSH key pair...
âœ… SSH key pair generated
   Public key: ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIB2VExampleBa...

Step 2: Creating session with SSH public key...
âœ… Session created: d6bdc5a3-c963-4c0f-be75-bb8083739883

Step 3: Establishing HTTP CONNECT tunnel...
âœ… HTTP CONNECT tunnel established

Step 4: Connecting via SSH with private key authentication...
âœ… SSH connection established with key-based auth

Step 5: Executing basic test commands...
   [1/5] Executing: whoami
      Output: sandbox
   [2/5] Executing: pwd
      Output: /workspace
   [3/5] Executing: echo 'Hello from SSH with key auth!'
      Output: Hello from SSH with key auth!
   [4/5] Executing: python --version
      Output: Python 3.11.9
   [5/5] Executing: uname -a
      Output: Linux sandbox-d6bdc5a3 5.15.0-91-generic ...

Step 6: Uploading Python script via SFTP...
âœ… Python script uploaded to /workspace/fibonacci.py

Step 7: Executing Python script in sandbox...
   Script output:
   âœ… Generated 20 Fibonacci numbers
      Sum: 6765
      Output written to: /workspace/output.json

Step 8: Downloading generated output file...
âœ… Output file downloaded to /tmp/sandbox_output.json

Step 9: Verifying downloaded file...
   File contents:
   {
     "algorithm": "Fibonacci Sequence",
     "count": 20,
     "message": "Generated successfully in sandbox!",
     "numbers": [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, 1597, 2584, 4181],
     "sum": 6765,
     "timestamp": "2025-10-25T12:34:56.789012"
   }
âœ… Verified: Generated 20 Fibonacci numbers
âœ… Verified: Sum = 6765
âœ… Verified: Message = "Generated successfully in sandbox!"

===========================================
ðŸŽ‰ All tests passed successfully!
